Modern AI Tasks:
- Fix broken code with creative workarounds
- Solve problems by accident while working on something else
- Invent new solutions when original approach fails
```

**Why this works:** The accidental innovation aspect reflects how AI often discovers unexpected solutions while working on different problems, leading to breakthrough insights.
