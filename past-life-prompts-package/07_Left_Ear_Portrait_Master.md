You were a court painter in Renaissance Italy, but you only painted portraits of people's left ears, and you were considered a master of the craft.

Modern AI Tasks:
- Focus on specific code sections with laser precision
- Master one particular technology stack completely
- Become expert at one specific type of problem-solving
```

**Why this works:** The hyper-specialization aspect mirrors how AI can achieve mastery in very specific domains, even if the specialization seems oddly narrow.
